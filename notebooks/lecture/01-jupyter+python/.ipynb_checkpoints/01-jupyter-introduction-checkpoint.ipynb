    "## Python in Jupyter environment\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python is one of the language supported by Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python is a popular programming language. It was created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
    "    Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
    "    Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n",
    "    Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n",
    "    Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.\n",
    "    Python is the most prominent language in the recent years:\n",
    "![noimg](images/python_growth.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Good to know\n",
    "\n",
    "The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.\n",
    "In this tutorial Python will be written in a JupyterLab. It is possible to write Python in other IDES (Integrated Development Environment) such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python was designed to for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.\n",
    "    Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\n",
    "    Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python Indentations\n",
    "\n",
    "    Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, in Python the indentation is very important. \n",
    "    Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    if 5 > 2: print(\"Five is greater than two!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #This is a comment. print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Python Docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python also has extended documentation capability, called docstrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Docstrings can be one line, or multiline. Docstrings are also comments:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Python uses triple quotes at the beginning and end of the docstring:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"\"\"This is a multiline docstring.\"\"\" print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
